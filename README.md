## Data
**[SQuAD 1.1 | Pranav Rajpurkar](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)**

## Introduction
Designing a Question and Answering (Q&A) system is a critical problem in the field of NLP and IR. Extensive use case and applications in businesses, academia and lifestyle. Helps to access the immense information and create systems which can answer natural language queries with relevant information. Q&A systems aid in rapidly getting the desired information without the need to go through the entire corpus.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to predict answers to the given set of questions with the help of embedding and transformer based models and evaluate their results.

## Tasks
• Created a scalable QnA model by leveraging preprocessed Word2Vec, SIF embeddings on SQuAD v1.1 with 100K+ pairs
• Achieved high accuracy of 81% EM and 84.5% F1-Score by implementing Distil-BERT-BERT ensemble transformer model


## Models
1. Embedding models: **Word2Vec, SIF**
2. Transformer models: **BERT, ALBERT, DISTILBERT**
